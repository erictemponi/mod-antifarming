# AntiFarming Module

This is a port of the AntiFarming Script from SymbolixDEV's repo to [AzerothCore](http://www.azerothcore.org)

## How to install

###1) Simply place the module under the `modules` folder of your AzerothCore source folder;

###2) Re-run cmake and launch a clean build of AzerothCore.

**That's it.**

### (Optional) Edit module configuration

If you need to change the module configuration, go to your server configuration folder (e.g. **etc**), copy `AntiFarming.conf.dist` to `AntiFarming.conf` and edit it as you prefer.
